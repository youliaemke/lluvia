        <p class="editable">Are you longing for a different kind of touch, for deep RELAXATION, just letting go of everything that is buzzing around in your head? Do you want to stimulate processes that might be stuck in your body?<br><br> Then you are exactly right here. I'll explain what I do and you just see if it resonates with you. <br><br> Key words for my kind of bodywork are, if you want to title it: <h2 class="lindsey"> Nourishing. Beneficial. Healing. </h2>My work is intuitive, paired with powerful massage techniques, such as Mayan Abdominal Massage , which I learned from my teacher and traditional midwives in Guatemala (learn more in my post about Abdominal Massage). <br><br> It goes beyond the mechanical movements of the hands; it's about creating a space where you can let go, surrender and reconnect with you. </p>

      <p class="editable"> As a practitioner, I am guided in my touch not only by technique, but also by intuition. I believe that your body holds the wisdom to heal itself, and I am here to support that process. <br><br> This is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Your session is tailored to your individual need, whether it's to address physical discomfort, manage stress, or connect more deeply with your self. It's about working with your body, not on it, in a way that respects your boundaries and preferences. <br><br> I work with a variety of herbal oils and products, many of which I make myself. There will be candlelight and if needed, I am happy to incense the room before and after to rebalance the energies.<br><br> In the soothing atmosphere of the therapy room, you will find a break from the demands of daily life. It is a sacred space where you can set your intentions, whether it is to relieve physical and emotional tension or simply to experience deep relaxation.  My goal is to offer you a safe and non-judgmental zone where you can be fully present and where I can guide you to come back to you, to home. </p>

  <p class="editable"> Especially in case of traumatic experiences with natural or self-induced miscarriage or pregnancies that have taken place, the two rituals mentioned above are very helpful and supportive to work through these issues. It is a special concern of mine to support women in this process. <br><br> <span class="emphasis">  If you have specific or acute diagnoses that require medical expertise, please consult a sports masseur, medical masseur or physical therapist. I am happy to support you as a secondary treatment. </span> </p>
