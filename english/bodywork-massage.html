        <p class="editable">Are you longing for a different kind of touch, for deep RELAXATION, just letting go of everything that is buzzing around in your head? Do you want to stimulate processes that might be stuck in your body?<br /><br /> Then you are exactly right here. I'll explain what I do and you just see if it resonates with you. <br /><br /> Key words for my kind of bodywork are, if you want to title it: </p><h2 class="lindsey"> Nourishing. Beneficial. Healing. </h2>My work is intuitive, paired with powerful massage techniques, such as Mayan Abdominal Massage , which I learned from my teacher and traditional midwives in Guatemala (learn more in my post about Abdominal Massage). <br /><br /> It goes beyond the mechanical movements of the hands; it's about creating a space where you can let go, surrender and reconnect with you. <p></p>

      <p class="editable"> As a practitioner, I am guided in my touch not only by technique, but also by intuition. I believe that your body holds the wisdom to heal itself, and I am here to support that process. <br /><br /> This is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Your session is tailored to your individual need, whether it's to address physical discomfort, manage stress, or connect more deeply with your self. It's about working with your body, not on it, in a way that respects your boundaries and preferences. <br /><br /> I work with a variety of herbal oils and products, many of which I make myself. There will be candlelight and if needed, I am happy to incense the room before and after to rebalance the energies.<br /><br /> In the soothing atmosphere of the therapy room, you will find a break from the demands of daily life. It is a sacred space where you can set your intentions, whether it is to relieve physical and emotional tension or simply to experience deep relaxation.  My goal is to offer you a safe and non-judgmental zone where you can be fully present and where I can guide you to come back to you, to home. </p>

        <h2 class="lindsey threerem editable"> Abdominal Massage:* </h2>
        <p class="editable"> The abdominal massage or Womb massage is like a dance between vulnerability and trust. It is an invitation to release the baggage we carry in our belly, whether it is the stress of a hectic week, the weight of unspoken worries, or deep-seated experiences and traumas we have experienced. Through regulated breathing, stroking, kneading, pressure movements and gentle manipulation, we release tension and blockages in the abdominal area. For more on abdominal massage, see the blog section. </p>

        <h2 class="lindsey threerem editable"> Spiritual Plant Wash:*</h2>
        <p class="editable">A spiritual plant wash is a ritual and sacred act using special plants and herbs to promote mental and energetic cleansing and spiritual renewal. Together we will select special plants that are appropriate for your individual spiritual needs. These plants are not only messengers of nature, but also carriers of wisdom and healing. They give you a warm embrace. Through the combined power of the plants and water, we seal the process of massage. This ritual has a strong purifying effect and it is important to rest or go into mediation afterwards.</p>

      <p class="editable">
          The head and heart massage is a holistic experience that focuses on the deep connection between the head and the heart. This form of massage combines physical touch with spiritual elements to promote mental clarity, emotional harmony and inner balance. You will have time to share your intentions, concerns and expectations before the treatment. This treatment will include the head, ears, neck and chest area. Gentle touch and intuitive acupressure can create relaxation and clarity. These touches aim to promote a sense of opening and letting go. This can help to release emotional blockages.

If you have any allergies or sensitivities, please let me know beforehand and we will see what we can put together for you.<br /><br /> Included in the price is also a pre - and debriefing and a delicious, warming herbal tea afterwards. ðŸŒ¿
