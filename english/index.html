      <h2 class="editable"> Hey, I'm Lluvia </h2>
      <p class="editable">& here are a few things I love and enjoy doing: 
      <ul>
        <li class="editable"> Helping people reconnect with their magic </li>
        <li class="editable"> Engaging with and applying ancient knowledge </li>
        <li class="editable"> Indulging your belly </li>
        <li class="editable"> To work in the kitchen to conjure up a variety of delicacies </li>
        <li class="editable"> Pure nature, collecting herbs, swimming in the river, BEING in the forest </li>
      </ul> The mystery of life and man and his motivations have always fascinated me.<br><br> I love life in all its glory. The smells, textures and tastes that life brings are also magically reflected in the kitchen, with all the wild, colorful ingredients it contains. Nature is my living room, plants my closest allies, fire my constant companion and water my faithful friend that holds me.<br><br> A main motive of my life is (emotional) expression. Expressing who you are and what you feel right now, without shame, without restraint. This means absolute freedom for me.<br><br> Helping others to do this and touching their innermost is a huge gift and gives me an incredible amount of joy. </p>

       <p class="editable"> Maybe it’s not about the place but about the prayers you speak into the earth wherever your feet walk. Maybe it’s not about finding a person, maybe it’s about seeing each being as a mirror with a unique message. Maybe it’s not about getting it together, maybe it’s about getting high enough to see the art of the bigger picture. Maybe it’s not about better but bare bones honesty. Maybe it’s not about trying because there are miracles that will never miss you. Maybe all you have to do is choose.
