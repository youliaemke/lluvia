          Hello nice that you found your way here, something seems to have called you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p class="editable">
          In my spiritual and body-conscious mentoring, I accompany you through the phases of change, the transitions and threshold moments that we all experience in life - moments in which orientation, inner peace and clarity are particularly important. <br /><br />This mentoring is an invitation to feel back into your body, organize your mind and listen to your inner voice. I work with you to create spaces in which you: <br /><br />- recognize and strengthen your own resources<br /><br />- release inner blockages that have been holding you<br /><br />- find new clarity and direction for decisions and life steps. <br /><br />The work is both body aware (somatic) and spiritual: <br /><br />Somatic: we focus attention on the body, feel what is present and use body awareness to promote clarity, balance and grounding. <br /><br />Spiritual: Through rituals, plant knowledge and mindful impulses, we open up spaces in which you can hear your intuition again and trust your inner compass. <br /><br />This mentoring supports you in consciously shaping your own path, embracing change and not just surviving transitions, but using them as opportunities for growth, healing and self-connection.

            Life has had a profound impact on me from a young age and through the experiences I have had, many of which have not been easy, my innate sensitivity, farsightedness and strong intuition have strengthened immensely. My understanding of life and death and the inevitable acceptance it brings has grown tremendously. I want to use these gifts, among others, to be a bridge for you on your path, a bridge to your Self, to the things that are often hidden. To help you understand yourself better, to connect more deeply with you and navigate your inner landscape with ease and grace.

           I accompany you in exploring your innermost self, gently healing old wounds, discovering your gifts and dissolving outdated beliefs. I support you in consciously shaping the process of your own development. <br /><br />In addition to my own impulses and intuition, I also use external tools - such as astrology, tarot, human design or the Gene Keys - to give you guidance, make hidden patterns visible and make your personal wisdom tangible.

        These are tools of origin that serve as a guide for me. They help me to sense what is currently alive in you, what currently needs to be worked on or is perhaps old but still present. In this way, aspects of your being or your life situation that were previously hidden or need more attention become visible.<br /> <br />A central aspect of my work is authenticity. I want to encourage you to live your own truth - not according to the norm or the ideas of others, but to follow your own unique path, with courage, curiosity and a lion's heart.<br /> <br />It is a space for curiosity, honesty, listening and questioning, where you can share your questions, doubts and experiences without fear of judgment. Here you will find support on your path to self-knowledge, self-realization and spiritual growth.<br /> <br />This mentoring is for you if you are ready to dive deep into yourself, to perceive your body, your soul and your intuition and to experience transformation as a conscious, grounded process.
