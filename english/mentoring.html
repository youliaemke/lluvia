          Hello nice that you found your way here, something seems to have called you.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p class="editable">
          In my spiritual and body-conscious mentoring, I accompany you through the phases of change, the transitions and threshold moments that we all experience in life - moments in which orientation, inner peace and clarity are particularly important. <br /><br />This mentoring is an invitation to feel back into your body, organize your mind and listen to your inner voice. I work with you to create spaces in which you: <br /><br />- recognize and strengthen your own resources<br /><br />- release inner blockages that have been holding you<br /><br />- find new clarity and direction for decisions and life steps. <br /><br />The work is both body aware (somatic) and spiritual: <br /><br />Somatic: we focus attention on the body, feel what is present and use body awareness to promote clarity, balance and grounding. <br /><br />Spiritual: Through rituals, plant knowledge and mindful impulses, we open up spaces in which you can hear your intuition again and trust your inner compass. <br /><br />This mentoring supports you in consciously shaping your own path, embracing change and not just surviving transitions, but using them as opportunities for growth, healing and self-connection.

            Life has had a profound impact on me from a young age and through the experiences I have had, many of which have not been easy, my innate sensitivity, farsightedness and strong intuition have strengthened immensely. My understanding of life and death and the inevitable acceptance it brings has grown tremendously. I want to use these gifts, among others, to be a bridge for you on your path, a bridge to your Self, to the things that are often hidden. To help you understand yourself better, to connect more deeply with you and navigate your inner landscape with ease and grace.

           I want to help you unravel your innermost self, heal old wounds, discover your gifts and dissolve old beliefs. To support the process of your unfolding.<br /><br />In addition to my inner gifts, I also use outer tools such as Astrology, Tarot and Human Design or the Gene Keys. </p>

      These are tools of origin that serve as guides for me. It helps me to sense what is going on with you right now, what is current, what may be old but still present. To tell me things about your being or current life situation, which may still lie hidden and want to be seen or simply need a little more attention. <br /><br /> One of the most important aspects for me is the idea of authenticity. I want to teach you the importance of living your own truth and not living according to the norm and idea of others. Walking your own unique path and following it with a lion's heart is what I want to encourage you to do.<br /><br />This process can help you further integrate values such as gratitude, forgiveness and acceptance into your life. I hope that our work together will be a valuable and life-changing experience for you, enriching your journey and deepening your understanding of yourself and the world around you. A relationship that nurtures your soul and supports you on your path of self-realization, self-responsibility and further development.
