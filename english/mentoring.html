          Hello nice that you found your way here
      </p>
      <p class="editable">
          In my spiritual and body-conscious mentoring, I accompany you through the phases of change, the transitions and threshold moments that we all experience in life - moments in which orientation, inner peace and clarity are particularly important.<br /><br />This mentoring is an invitation to feel back into your body, organize your mind and listen to your inner voice. I work with you to create spaces in which you can:<br />Recognize and strengthen your own resources, release inner blockages that have been holding you down, find new clarity and direction for decisions and life steps.<br /><br />A central aspect of my work is authenticity. I want to encourage you to live your own truth - not according to the norm or the ideas of others, but to follow your own unique path, with courage, curiosity and a lion's heart.<br /><br />It is a space for curiosity, honesty, listening and questioning, where you can share your questions, doubts and experiences without fear of judgment. Here you will find support on your path to self-knowledge, self-realization and spiritual growth.<br /> <br />

            &nbsp;The work is both body-conscious and spiritual: <br /><br /><em><strong>body-conscious (somatic)</strong>:</em> In these sessions, we consciously focus attention on your body and feel what is currently present. With visualizations, breathing and mindfulness exercises, you open up spaces in which you can reconnect with your body, release tension, activate resources and connect deeply with yourself. <br /><br />Each session is individually designed so that you consciously perceive your body's signals and experience your inner wisdom through it. Your body becomes a reliable anchor that carries you through transitions and processes of change. <br /><br /><em>Spiritual:</em> At the same time, it is about perceiving yourself as a whole soul and understanding your energetic field in harmony with the larger collective. We work with various tools that support you intuitively - including meditations, rituals, plant knowledge, mindfulness impulses or other individually suitable methods.<br /><br /> Everything is tailor-made so that you are picked up where you are and learn to trust your inner wisdom. <br /><br />This mentoring supports you in consciously shaping your own path, embracing change and not just surviving transitions, but using them as opportunities for growth, healing and self-connection.

           I accompany you in exploring your innermost self, gently healing old wounds, discovering your gifts and dissolving outdated beliefs. I support you in consciously shaping the process of your own development. <br /><br />In addition to my own impulses and intuition, I also use external tools - such as astrology, tarot, human design or the Gene Keys - to give you guidance, make hidden patterns visible and make your personal wisdom tangible.

        These are tools of origin that serve as a guide for me. They help me to sense what is currently alive in you, what currently needs to be worked on or is perhaps old but still present. In this way, aspects of your being or your life situation that were previously hidden or need more attention become visible.<br /> <br />This mentoring is for you if you are ready to dive deep into yourself, to perceive your body, your soul and your intuition and to experience transformation as a conscious, grounded process.
