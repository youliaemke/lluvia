        Who am I and what has shaped me?
    </h2>
    <p class="editable">
        Sensitive person, herbalist, passionate cook, touch &amp; life artist.<br /><br />I am shaped by dualities. A colorful mix of extrovert and introvert. Some days I love to share my space, other days I need and enjoy my own space just for me.<br /><br />I am an open book, learning to express my feelings and desires every day. It wasn't always that way, though.<br /><br />Here is something about my personal story:<br />Due to quite a few obstacles and challenges in my life on the subject of expressiveness, marked with strong self-doubt, it has often been extremely difficult for me to express my feelings or to say what I actually need.<br /><br />I grew up in a loving home, for which I am very grateful. I was allowed to experience a lot of physical affection, especially through my mother. What was a gift and is still reflected today in my touch and I may pass on, professionally and privately.<br /><br />However, there was a lack of communication between us. To really say what the other feels was not the norm, which was certainly also due to the ubiquitous zeitgeist and how my parents had been brought up.<br /><br />I was a very bright and at the same time extremely sensitive, dreamy child. A dreamer, they say. I often started crying bitterly when I was actually angry. I knew no outlet for anger or disappointment. One result of this blockage was shame, a sense of otherness, and an underlying feeling of not being understood.<br /><br />By the time I was 13, I had become very interested in the occult. The "other" world fascinated me, the mystical magically attracted. I could withdraw into this world and felt safe and seen. At that time I was not yet aware of how much this influenced a relationship to my spirituality. The acceptance and curiosity in things that you do not have to prove or explain, but simply feel.<br /><br />When my father died at the age of 15 and my mother 6 years later, it was the beginning of one of the greatest initiations of my life. I fell into a quagmire of substance abuse, repression and isolation from the rest of my family and old friends. All I wanted was to be intoxicated and feel NOTHING, not to be confronted with my past and the unbearable feeling of abandonment.<br /><br />Eventually love tickled me out, I moved to the other side of Germany and started over and slowly built a regular life again.<br /><br />I then spent 8 wonderful years in Freiburg. Loved, lived, experienced deep sisterhood.&nbsp; At the end of my 20s it was time to change things and go new ways. I only say Saturn Return! Dive with pleasure still more deeply with you into the matter of this exciting time which everybody lives through, however, I do this in a separate blog entry. . My urge for adventure, departure and new experiences could no longer be suppressed. My inner voice became so loud, I wanted to go out into the wide world and get out of my daily routine.<br /><br />My time traveling was a giant leap into my inner world. I was allowed to discover new ways of living for myself and, above all, to rediscover myself.<br /><br />Feeling things I was not ready to feel before, learning from other cultures, living with nature, acquiring plant knowledge, creating my own medicine, learning about rituals and ceremonies, getting to know a whole new kind of intimacy.<br /><br />This time was marked not only by ecstasy, but also by deep pain and loss. In a relatively short period of time, I experienced three pregnancy losses. Which triggered a deep process of self-healing, stirred up many inner issues, and ultimately initiated me with the powerful knowledge of the womb.<br /><br />Through my experience of loss, I have come to appreciate life and especially love even more. Deep grief has also awakened an immense desire for life and all its magic. My connection to the great mystery deepened. Acceptance of what is and the ability to accept the cycle of life as it comes have become my strengths.<br /><br />The stars take back what they have lent you and you learn to dance with it...<br /><br />I am happy to accompany you on your path, in whatever way this may be. I am looking forward to connecting and seeing what we can weave together.
