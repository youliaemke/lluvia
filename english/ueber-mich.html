          Lluvia, Sensualist, Bodyworker, Herbalist, passionate Chef, Artist of Life &amp; Connection<br /><br />I appreciate the diversity of life and meet it with curiosity and appreciation, embracing all its facets. My journey has taken me through the highs and lows of existence, from the challenge of expressing my feelings to the deep connection with nature and its healing powers. Even as a child I was a dreamy creature. The early loss of my parents deeply shook my foundation and led me into a phase of repression and numbness without even realizing it. <br /><br />But the longing for adventure and self-discovery made me take new paths and at some point I grabbed my rucksack and followed the call of the wide world. I immersed myself in foreign cultures, learned from wise herbalists and discovered the magic of plants. These experiences opened my heart and taught me to accept life as constant change and today I am a devoted student of herbalism, somatic movement and astrology.<br /><br /> I listen to the quiet stories of our plant allies and weave their wisdom into handcrafted remedies for the body, heart and mind. With healing hands and a nurturing presence, I offer intuitive bodywork and create spaces for deep rest and remembrance. I am currently training as a doula to support women in their many transitions and stages of life.<br /><br />I have walked many paths, bringing my nourishing spirit, embodied wisdom and gentle guidance into the spaces I hold - creating a place where you can connect with yourself and the whispering within you.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />The quintessence that I can draw from my life so far is that we get further together than alone.<br /><br />If you feel like it, contact me and we will see what we can weave together.<br /><br />with a lot of heart<br /><br />Xx Lluvia xX
