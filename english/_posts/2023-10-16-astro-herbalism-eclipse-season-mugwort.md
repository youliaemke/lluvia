  Eclipse season can evoke a range of feelings and experiences, both on a
  personal and collective level. It can feel like pulling the furniture away
  from the walls to find years of dust, lost pens, crumpled up notes, and dead
  spiders.

Eclipse season can evoke a range of feelings and experiences, both on a personal and collective level. It can feel like pulling the furniture away from the walls to find years of dust, lost pens, crumpled up notes, and dead spiders.&nbsp;

Feelings like:

* Uncertainty
* Intense energy
* Change and Transformation
* Release and Letting Go
* Synchronicities&nbsp;
* Personal Growth
* Mood Swings
* Collective Events

are likely to occur. Keep in mind that the impact of eclipse energy varies from person to person, depending on their birth chart and the specific planetary aspects involved. Some people may experience the effects more strongly than others.&nbsp;



**Working with a Moon herb, such as Mugwort, helps us to connect with our lunar selves / subconscious selves.**&nbsp;While many of us know our Sun sign, we don’t know our Moon sign which represents our most intimate truths about ourselves.&nbsp;[Knowing your Moon](http://www.wortsandcunning.com/lunar-apothecary){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"} means that you are better able to distribute the power of your Sun throughout your life. Working with Mugwort during eclipse season is one way to enhance your dreams, a primary mode of communication between our conscious selves and lunar selves. The herb can also help to unlock and enhance psychic gifts. If you’ve been denying your psychic gifts, eclipse season can be a time to reconnect with them, and Mugwort can help to open the path.

Give it a go and drink some Mugwort Tea or use some Mugwort Tincture. If you never made your own Tincture it’s maybe time now or get one of my or other trusted medicine blends.

Don't forget the Eclipse Season always contains strong opportunities for Personal Growth and Evolution in our Lives.
