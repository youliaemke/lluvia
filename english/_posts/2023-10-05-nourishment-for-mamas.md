Cooking for mothers is an act of love, a way to express gratitude and appreciation for the incredible women who have brought life into this world. It's not just about preparing a meal; it's a heartfelt gesture that says, "Thank you for all you do."

The aromas of a well-prepared meal bring back memories and soothe the soul. It's like a taste of home, a reminder that even though life has changed dramatically, there are constants that remain - love, care and nourishment.

Cooking for moms is an opportunity to celebrate the incredible strength and resilience it takes to be a mom. It's a reminder that their well-being is just as important as that of their children. It's a recognition that she, too, deserves to be nurtured and cared for.

What makes this act of cooking even more special is the personal touch it often brings. It is not an ordinary meal, but a dish that is tailored to their tastes, preferences and nutritional needs. It is a comfort dish, a reminder that someone knows them, sees them, and loves them enough to prepare something that is truly enjoyable.

So thank you to all of you who cook for moms. Your meals are not just food; they are tokens of love and appreciation that touch the heart of every mother deeply.

A little bit about my personal motivations. I am not a mother yet and I don't know if it is meant for me in this life, we shall see. Though I was allowed to become pregnant 3 times, it was not the time for her to come physically to this earth though, at least not through me. This experience brought me deep into the origin of my being and led me to the path I am on now and made me realize that I want to support women in the process of birth as well as the process of loss. Which does not have to be in physical form.
