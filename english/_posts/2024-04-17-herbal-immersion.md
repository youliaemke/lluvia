#### Hey there, fellow seekers of magic and wonder!

&nbsp;

Are you ready to embark on a journey into the enchanting world of Herbs & Sisterhood? If so, I have an invitation that’s bound to ignite your senses and nourish your soul.

Picture this: nestled amidst the whispering trees and fragrant meadows and hills lies a haven of serenity, a sanctuary where the ancient wisdom of herbs beckons you to explore its depths. Welcome to our Herbal Immersion Retreat, where nature’s bounty becomes our guide and healer.

&nbsp;![Herbal Medicine Wheel Garden](/uploads/mandala-2022-1.jpeg)![magical land of lachusol enaid](/uploads/iachusol-enaid-towards-valley-1.jpg)![](/uploads/tree-in-corner-of-valley-2.jpg)

Join us for a soul-stirring adventure filled with potion-making, herb harvesting, and mystical rituals under the gentle guidance of seasoned herbalists and wise earth guardians. Together, we’ll delve into the secrets of the plant kingdom, unlocking the potent magic hidden within each leaf, flower, and root.

From dawn until dusk, we’ll immerse ourselves in the art of herbal alchemy, crafting potions and salves infused with the healing energies of the earth. Through hands-on workshops and experiential learning and daily Ceremonies you’ll uncover the ancient rituals and sacred practices that connect us to the natural world and awaken our innate wisdom.

But our journey doesn’t end there. Amidst the tranquil beauty of our surroundings, we’ll gather around the fire to share stories, songs, and laughter, forging bonds that transcend time and space. As the stars twinkle overhead, we’ll honor the ancestors and spirits that walk beside us, weaving a tapestry of connection and belonging.

##### Rustic Comfort Meets Nature’s Symphony

Your stay is defined by a connection with nature. Five fully insulated cabins, with two single beds, void of electricity, invites you to unwind completely.

Simple to disconnect.

##### Nourishment for Body and Soul

In the heart of the field, a large outdoor fire circle, becomes a center for communal warmth.  Our reciprocal roof outdoor kitchen, with a round table seating 12, provides a space to share stories and laughter. Quench your thirst with the fresh filtered spring water from our land.

This epically build Geodesic Dome, offers indoor space with a log burner and electricity.

We will have 3 vegan plant based Meals, sometimes prepared directly on the Fire. Our wonderful Chef Carmel will surprise us through weaving the Herbs we will working with, into our Food Experience. We will use the minimum amount of Oil, Salt and (hot) Spices to enhance our experience to connect deeper with our beloved Plant Spirits.

Please feel free to bring your own Snacks, we absolutely welcome this. We would just ask you to stay away from highly processed Food as this will be counteracting with the Experience you can have.
