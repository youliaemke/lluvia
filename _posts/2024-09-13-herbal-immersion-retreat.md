&nbsp;

Join us for 4 days of immersion into our most beloved local British plant allies.

We will be sitting with Rosemary, Hawthorn and Mugwort as they take us on our journeys.

Learn deeply their materia medica, make tinctures and oils. Sit with them over tea and listen to them speak.

This will be more than just a herbal immersion, this is a ceremony, a deep connection with the plant world as well as with like minded sisters, witches, healers and wise women.

Sharing time, wisdom, tea, and delicious feasts. Yoga, meditation, journaling, foraging, fires, dancing
